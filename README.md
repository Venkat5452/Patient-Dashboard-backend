# Healthcare Management Backend

This repository contains the backend code for a healthcare management application designed to manage patient data effectively and facilitate prior authorization requests. The application is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It provides RESTful APIs for user authentication, patient management, and authorization requests.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login endpoints with email OTP verification.
- **Patient Management**: API endpoints to add, retrieve, and manage patient details.
- **Prior Authorization**: Endpoints for submitting and retrieving prior authorization requests for patients.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API requests.
- **Secure Email Verification**: OTP-based email verification for new user registration.

## Getting Started
